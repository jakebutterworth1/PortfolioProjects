# PortfolioProjects
This SQL project focuses on illustrating fundamental examples of common SQL operations, utilizing four key tables: customers, orders, returns, and managers.
While the project doesn't address any particular business query, its aim is to demonstrate how typical business questions could be effectively tackled by manipulating data in SQL.
Additionally, selected outcomes have been visualized in an interactive Tableau dashboard, enhancing the accessibility and interpretability of the data insights.
